# Load a scenario

Once you've set up a client and assigned it to all the agents, you will be presented with the `Home` screen. From here, you can load talemate scenarios and upload character cards.

To load the introductory `Infinity Quest` scenario, simply click on its entry in the `Quick Load` section.

!!! info "First time may take a moment"
    When you load the a scenario for the first time, Talemate will need to initialize the long term memory model. Which likely means a download. Just be patient and it will be ready soon.

## Interacting with the scenario

After a moment of loading, you will see the scenario's introductory message and be able to send a text interaction.

Its time to send the first message.

Spoken words should go into `"` and actions should be written in `*`. Talemate will automatically supply the other if you supply one.

Once sent, its now the AI's turn to respond - depending on the service and model selected this can take a a moment.

## Quick overview of UI elements

### Scenario tools

Above the chat input there is a set of tools to help you interact with the scenario. You may also notice an **agent activity bar** appearing above the tools when agents are working - this shows which agents are currently processing in the background.
