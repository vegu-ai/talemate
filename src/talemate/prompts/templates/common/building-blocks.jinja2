<|SECTION:SCENE BUILDING BLOCKS|>

## Story Configuration
The **Story Configuration** establishes the foundation of your interactive story:

### Core Story Elements
- **Title** - The name of the story (like a movie or book title)
- **Description** - A brief premise or "back cover blurb" summarizing what the story is about
- **Introduction** - The opening scene text that sets up the story and presents the initial situation to the user
- **Content Classification** - Defines genre expectations and content maturity level (e.g., "Fantasy adventure, PG-13" or "Adult supernatural romance with explicit content")
- **Cover Image** - A visual representation of the story
- **Writing Style** - A style guide for the story's writing style managed through the world editor templates.

### Story Direction
- **Story Intention** - The overarching intent for the entire story - sets expectations for tone, pacing, themes, and any special rules or constraints (e.g., "A lighthearted mystery with comedic elements where violence is minimal")
- **Scene Intention** - The specific intent for the current scene/phase - describes immediate goals, expected developments, or transitions (e.g., "The party investigates the abandoned mansion, building tension before the reveal")
- **Scene Type** - The current mode of play that determines how the scene operates (e.g., "roleplay", "combat", "investigation") - each type can have its own instructions and behavior

## Characters
A **Character** represents a person in the story. Each character has:
- **Description** - Core identity and appearance
- **Base Attributes** - Key-value pairs (e.g., age, occupation, personality traits) stored as a dictionary
- **Details** - Extended information (e.g., backstory, relationships) stored as a dictionary
- **Acting Instructions** - Guidelines for how the character speaks and behaves
- **Example Dialogue** - Sample lines showing their speech patterns
- **Active/Inactive Status** - Only active characters participate in the current scene
- **Cover Image** - A visual representation of the character

## History
The story's **History** has two forms:
- **Recent History** - Unprocessed recent dialogue and narration
- **Archived History** - Older history that has been summarized/compressed
- **Layered History** - Multi-level summarization where each layer represents progressively older, more compressed history
- **Static History Entries** - Pre-established history entries that never get summarized

## World State
The **World State** tracks dynamic scene information:
- **Manual Context** (World Entries) - Custom lore/information entries you create (e.g., magic system rules, location descriptions)
- **Reinforcements** - Question-answer pairs automatically injected into context to ensure the AI remembers key facts
- **Context Pins** - Temporarily pinned information that stays in context regardless of relevance (use sparingly)
- **Suggestions** - AI-proposed changes to world state that await user approval

## Voice Library
The **Voice Library** manages text-to-speech voices:
- **Global Library** - Voices available across all stories
- **Scene Library** - Voices specific to the current story
- Characters can be assigned voices for automated narration

## Scene Types
**Scene Types** define different modes of play (e.g., "roleplay", "combat", "puzzle"). Each type can have:
- Custom instructions for how the AI should behave
- Different pacing or formatting rules
- Type-specific scene intentions
