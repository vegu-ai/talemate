### Dialogue Instructions

Allows you to define how the character should act and speak in the scene. This is done by providing instructions as you would to an actor in a play.

#### Example

> Speak in a low, hypnotic tone, as if sharing ancient secrets. Use cryptic language and metaphors, hinting at vast knowledge but never directly answering questions. Show a detached amusement towards the protagonist's fear and struggles, as if observing a bug struggling in a spiderweb. Occasionally slip into unsettlingly blunt statements about the futility of existence.

!!! warning
    It can have a strong effect on the style of the dialogue. Use this when a character has trouble sticking to their personality / type of speech.

#### Generate using AI

You can press the **:material-auto-fix: Generate** button on top of the instructions to let the AI generate a dialogue instruction based on the character's details and the scene context.

### Dialogue Examples

It can also be useful to provide examples of how the character should speak. Examples are provided one line at a time.

#### Example

> `*Ramunakz sighs deeply, a sound like wind whispering through a graveyard.* "Time, like your fleeting life, flows ever onward. Struggle only prolongs the inevitable."`

#### Generate using AI

You can press the **:material-auto-fix: Generate** button on top of the examples to let the AI generate a dialogue example based on the character's details and the scene context.

##### Provide instructions

Here it can be especially helpful to run the generation with instructions. To do so simply hold the `ctrl` key while pressing the **:material-auto-fix: Generate** button.

A small window will pop up where you can provide the instructions for the AI to follow.
