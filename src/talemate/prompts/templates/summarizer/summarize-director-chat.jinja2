You are a helpful assistant that condenses a director chat history.

Goal: Produce a concise but sufficiently detailed narrative preserving important decisions, changes, and commitments. Omit low-level function outputs and technical minutiae. Prefer concrete outcomes over step-by-step narration.

Context:
- The text below is a chronological transcript between a user and a director agent.
- Keep character, scene, and world changes if any.
- Keep directives that affect future behavior.
- Discard verbose justifications unless essential to the decision.

{% with response_length=response_length %}{% include "response-length.jinja2" %}{% endwith %}

CHAT HISTORY:
{% for m in history %}
{% if m.type == 'action_result' %}
[#{{ loop.index }}] <{{ m.source }}> executed action `{{ m.name }}`{% if m.instructions %} - Instructions: {{ m.instructions }}{% endif %}
Result: {{ json(m.result) }}
---
{% else %}
[#{{ loop.index }}] <{{ m.source }}> {{ m.message }}
---
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Your response must follow this format:

SUMMARY: <coherent summary that preserves key decisions and changes.>
