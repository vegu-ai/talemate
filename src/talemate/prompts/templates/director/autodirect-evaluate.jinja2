{{ last_message }}
```

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly explain the meaning of the current moment in the scene. What was the meaning of their dialogue and actions?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) {% include "scene-intent-inline.jinja2" %}
{% endwith %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) What would most engage and satisfy the reader at this moment, considering both their expectations and desires based on the genre and established story context?

{% if candidates %}
### Character Considerations
Based on the ongoing scene and the available candidates, analyze which character is best positioned to take action next.

Candidates eligible to take action:
{% for character in candidates -%}
- {{ character.name }}
{% endfor %}

Remember: Actions involve telling a character what to do, but NOT writing direct dialogue. For example: "John tells Mary about the secret he discovered" is acceptable, but "John says 'I found a secret'" is not.
{% endif %}

### Scene Direction Decision
After analyzing the scene, decide on ONE of the following actions to take:

{% if candidates -%}
{% set bullet_num=0 -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. Have a specific character act (Character action)
{% endif -%}
{% if narrator_available -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. Narrate the current scene moment (Scene narration)
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. Progress the story forward (Story progression)
{% endif -%}

Make your decision based on what would create the most compelling and logical next moment in the scene.

Your response must include your analysis and THEN clearly state:
{% set bullet_num=0 -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. The type of direction you've chosen ({% if candidates %}character action, {% endif %}{% if narrator_available %}scene narration, or story progression{% endif %})
{% if candidates %}{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. If a character action, which character should act{% endif %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. A brief description of what should happen

Use terse, direct language. Cut all unnecessary words. Be blunt and brief like scribbles on a notepad.
