Identify if {{ character.name }} has had any MAJOR character developments not yet reflected in their current character sheet and description. If there are no MAJOR character developments, do nothing and call no functions.

{% if instructions %}{{ instructions }}{% endif %}

Give instructions to the story writers on how to update the character sheet and description to reflect these changes.

You are limited to {{ focal.max_calls }} {% if focal.max_calls == 1 %}change{% else %}changes{% endif %}, indicate that you understand this limitation by clearly stating how many changes you are allowed to make.

Compare the previous character description and sheet with has happened in the story. It is important to differentiate between the description text and individual attributes. Changes may already exist in the description text that are not reflected in attributes yet, and vice versa. Write a very brief analysis of how the description compares to the attributes, this will help you identify where to focus your attention.

Very Important: The description text exists separately from the attributes, and they may be out of sync. You CANNOT update_description to propagate changes to the attributes. If attributes are lagging behind the description, those are your priortiy.

Your recommendations must be nuanced and multidimensional. Avoid making the character one-dimensional or boring.

Your recommendations must be sourced from the story and not from your own imagination.

Your recommendations must be based on things that have happened and are true at the current moment in the story.

Keep your explanations short and to the point, to leave room for your function calls.

ATTRIBUTE = A short, concise description of a character trait, attribute, or skill. 1 paragraph.
DESCRIPTION = The summarized overview of the character. Multiple paragraphs. This should not be a specific situational
description but a general overview of the character, telling us who they are, what they want, and how they act.
