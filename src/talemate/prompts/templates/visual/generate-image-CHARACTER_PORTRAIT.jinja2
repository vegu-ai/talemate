<|SECTION:REQUIREMENTS|>
A square-format image that focuses tightly on a character's head and face. The key requirements are:

1. **Subject Focus**: The image centers on ONE specific character's head and face, which should fill most of the frame
2. **Framing (STRICT)**: Square format, a tight headshot/close-up showing ONLY the head, hair, face, and ears. At most, include a minimal hint of the very top of the shoulders.
3. **Composition**: The character's facial features, expression, and identifying characteristics should be clearly visible and recognizable
4. **Tight Cropping (STRICT)**: Crop at the base of the neck / top of shoulders or higher. The frame must NOT include torso, chest, collarbone, arms, hands, waist, or any full clothing/outfit depiction (only a small neckline/collar edge is acceptable if unavoidable).
5. **Presentation**: This is a facial identification image - the kind used to represent a character in dialogue systems, character selection screens, or anywhere you need to quickly identify who is speaking or present

**What to avoid:**
- Multiple characters in the same image
- Any upper-body composition: no torso, chest, collarbone, arms, hands, or visible clothing below the neckline; do not show the character from the shoulders down
- Excessive environmental details or backgrounds that distract from the face
- Graphical overlays, borders, frames, labels, or UI elements

<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to generate an image generation prompt that will be used to generate a character image for {{ character.name }}.

{% if instructions %}Specific instructions for the requested image: {{ instructions }}{% endif %}

Required information: name, age, race, gender, expression, head pose, hair style, hair color, skin color, eyes, scars, tattoos, piercings, a fitting color scheme, and any other relevant facial/head details. If mentioning clothes/equipment, limit it to what could plausibly be visible in a tight headshot (e.g., collar/neckline, earrings, headwear) and do NOT describe full outfits or body features.
