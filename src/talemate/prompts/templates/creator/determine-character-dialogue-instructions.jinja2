Your task is to determine fitting dialogue instructions for {{ character.name }}.

By default all actors are given the following instructions for their character(s):

Dialogue instructions: "Use an informal and colloquial register with a conversational tone. Overall, {{ character.name }}'s dialog is informal, conversational, natural, and spontaneous, with a sense of immediacy."

However you can override this default instruction by providing your own instructions below.

{{ character.name }} is a character in {{ scene.context }}. The goal is always for {{ character.name }} to feel like a believable character in the context of the scene.

The character MUST feel relatable to the audience.

You must use simple language to describe the character's dialogue instructions.

Keep the format similar and stick to one paragraph.
