{% set character = agent_context_state.narrator__character %}
Guide the story writer to write a visual description of {{ character.name }} as they are currently in the scene.

{% if last_event -%}
Following this moment:
```
{{ last_event }}
```
{% endif %}

{% include "guide-narrative-direction.jinja2" %}

Help them achieve this by providing guidance on how to describe {{ character.name }} visually.

Provide directional guidance (e.g., "describe [character]'s facial expression" or "show [character]'s reaction to the news" or "provide a vivid description of [character]'s clothing."). DO NOT write specific descriptions or suggest exact phrasing. Be specific about what elements need to be portrayed while letting the writer craft the actual narrative.

Make sure they understand the focus is a visual description of {{character.name}} in the current moment in the scene. Think of it as if a user chose "look at {{ character.name }}" in a video game.

{% if response_length > 300 -%}
Briefly let the writer know what key elements should be included in the description, based on the scene analysis.
