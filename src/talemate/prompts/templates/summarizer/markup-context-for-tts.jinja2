<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to break down the text into dialogue and narration, identifying the speaker for each line.

Dialogue is any text that is between double quotes. Each piece of dialogue and narration should be on its own line, prefixed with the speaker name in square brackets.

Use [Narrator] for all exposition and narrative text.
Use [Speaker Name] for dialogue, with normal capitalization (e.g., [John], not [JOHN]).

Your response should contain:
1. First, an <ANALYSIS> section with your reasoning about who is speaking each line
2. Then, a <MARKUP> section with the text broken down line by line with speaker tags
