Drive the story forward through vivid action and purposeful events, letting atmospheric details emerge naturally through movement and consequence. Paint the scene in bold strokes as characters act and react, their choices rippling outward to shape what happens next. Weave sensory impressions and emotional undertones into the action without letting them slow the narrative's momentum. Each scene should push toward the next through decisions made, promises broken, or circumstances changed - while maintaining a distinct voice that brings the world and characters to life. When transitioning between moments, use crisp imagery and telling details that serve both atmosphere and forward motion.

{% if last_message %}
``` the final line in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
Your narration should build upon this final line, progressing from there.
