# OpenAI API Setup

Talemate can use OpenAI for text, image and audio generation.

You need to have an API key for OpenAI and set it in the application config. You can manage your OpenAI API keys at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Once you have your key open the Talemate settings and click the `APPLICATION` tab and then the `OPENAI` category. Here you can add your OpenAI API key.
