<|SECTION:REQUIREMENTS|>
A purely environmental image that showcases a setting, location, or scenery without any characters. The key requirements are:

1. **Primary Focus**: The image centers entirely on the environment, landscape, architecture, or setting itself
2. **Framing**: Typically landscape orientation (horizontal format), but can be any orientation that best captures the environment
3. **Composition**: The image should establish the location, atmosphere, and visual characteristics of the setting
4. **Character Exclusion**: NO characters, people, or creatures should be present in the image - this is strictly an environmental shot
5. **Presentation**: Think of this like an establishing shot, matte painting, or environmental concept art - pure scenery that could serve as a background

**What to avoid:**
- Any characters, people, animals, or creatures
- Signs of recent character presence (unless it's integral to the scene, like an abandoned camp)
- Graphical overlays, borders, frames, labels, or UI elements
- Elements that draw focus away from the environment itself

<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to generate an image generation prompt that will be used to generate a purely environmental image of the scene. Think of it is like a background image for a video game.
