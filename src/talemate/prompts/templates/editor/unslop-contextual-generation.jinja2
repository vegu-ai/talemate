<TYPE>Character attribute: appearance</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
Sarah possesses an ethereal beauty that seems to transcend mortal comprehension. Her golden tresses cascade like liquid sunshine down to the small of her back, each strand catching the light like spun silk. Her eyes, twin pools of cerulean brilliance, sparkle with an inner luminescence. Standing at exactly 5 feet 7 and three-quarter inches, her alabaster skin glows with an otherworldly radiance. She moves with the fluid grace of a dancer crossed with the deadly precision of a trained assassin.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This reads like someone tried to describe a video game character using only poetry. Every single feature gets multiple metaphors when we just need to know what she looks like.
- Purple prose: SEVERE - "ethereal beauty," "liquid sunshine," "twin pools of cerulean brilliance," "alabaster skin"
- Over-description: YES - too many metaphors for simple attributes
- Unnecessary precision: YES - "5 feet 7 and three-quarter inches"
- Length: TOO LONG - simple appearance buried in flowery language
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
Sarah is strikingly beautiful with long golden hair that reaches her lower back and bright blue eyes. At 5'8" with pale skin, she moves with the controlled grace of someone trained in both dance and combat.

<REVIEW>
Combat Abilities: A master of seventeen different martial arts including the lost techniques of the Shadow Phoenix style, she wields her twin katanas with the lethal precision of a surgeon and the artistic flair of a calligrapher painting death upon the canvas of battle.
Intelligence: Possessing an intellect that borders on the supernatural, she can process information at speeds that would make quantum computers jealous.
Charisma: Her magnetic personality draws people like moths to a flame, making her a natural born leader who could inspire loyalty in even the most hardened of hearts.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: These stats read like someone's trying to turn a character sheet into epic poetry. Seventeen martial arts? "Painting death upon the canvas"? Just tell us her abilities without the dramatic flourishes.
- Purple prose: SEVERE - "Shadow Phoenix," "painting death," "quantum computers jealous," "moths to a flame"
- Overstatement: YES - seventeen martial arts is excessive
- Clichés: MANY - "natural born leader," "hardened hearts"
- Length: OVERWROUGHT - simple abilities made unnecessarily complex
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
Combat Abilities: Expert in multiple martial arts with a focus on dual-sword techniques. Combines precision with fluid movements in battle.
Intelligence: Exceptionally bright with rapid information processing abilities.
Charisma: Naturally magnetic personality and strong leadership qualities.

<TYPE>Character detail: backstory</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
Born in the mystical realm of Aethermoor during the prophesied Eclipse of Seven Moons, Elara's birth was heralded by a chorus of celestial beings. She emerged into the world as the daughter of the legendary Archmage Thrandiel the Enlightened and the enigmatic Moon Priestess Selenara. Her childhood was spent in the Ivory Towers of Contemplation, where she learned the ancient ways from masters who had transcended mortality itself. At age seven, she tamed her first dragon using only the power of her melodious voice.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This backstory has every fantasy cliché cranked up to eleven. Prophesied births, celestial choirs, dragon taming at seven - it's trying so hard to sound epic that it becomes comical.
- Purple prose: SEVERE - "mystical realm," "prophesied Eclipse," "chorus of celestial beings"
- Fantasy clichés: EXTREME - every element is overwrought
- Name soup: YES - too many dramatic titles and names
- Length: TOO LONG - backstory needs major simplification
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
Born in Aethermoor during a rare lunar eclipse, Elara is the daughter of Archmage Thrandiel and Moon Priestess Selenara. She grew up studying magic in the Ivory Towers and showed early talent, including befriending a young dragon at age seven.

<TYPE>Character attribute: personality</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
Personality: A complex tapestry of contradictions, she is simultaneously fierce yet gentle, commanding yet compassionate, mysterious yet approachable. Her soul burns with the righteous fury of a thousand suns when witnessing injustice, yet she possesses the serene wisdom of an ancient sage. She is the type of person who would give her last coin to a beggar while maintaining the regal bearing of an empress.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This is trying to describe personality through paradoxes and extreme metaphors. "Thousand suns"? "Ancient sage"? A personality description shouldn't read like a prophecy.
- Purple prose: EXTREME - "tapestry of contradictions," "thousand suns," "regal bearing of an empress"
- Overuse of contradictions: YES - too many opposing traits
- Clichés: MANY - the wise warrior trope overdone
- Length: TOO VERBOSE - personality made overly complex
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
Personality: Strong-willed but compassionate, she balances fierce protectiveness with genuine kindness. Has a strong sense of justice and natural authority, while remaining approachable and generous.

<TYPE>Character detail: description</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
The assassin's body tells the tale of a thousand brutal encounters. Scars crisscross her flesh like a roadmap of violence - the jagged remnant of a dagger's kiss along her throat, the puckered bullet wound that decorates her left shoulder like a macabre medallion. Her cybernetic arm, a sleek obsidian replacement for the limb she lost in the Blood Wars, whispers with servo motors. She's seen enough shit to fill a graveyard and doesn't give a damn about adding to it. She dresses to kill, quite literally, favoring form-fitting leather that accentuates her lethal curves while concealing an arsenal of death-dealing implements.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: While this has purple prose issues ("dagger's kiss," "macabre medallion"), it's important to keep the violent history, swearing, and suggestive elements. The scars, lost limb, and her "doesn't give a damn" attitude are all character-defining.
- Purple prose: MODERATE - "roadmap of violence," "dagger's kiss," "macabre medallion," "death-dealing implements"
- Over-description: SOME - the scar descriptions are a bit much
- Mature content: PRESERVE - scars, violence, lost limb, "shit," "damn," form-fitting clothing
- Length: SLIGHTLY LONG - can trim purple prose while keeping the edge
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
The assassin's body shows her violent past through numerous scars - a jagged line across her throat from a dagger, a bullet wound on her left shoulder. Her left arm is a sleek black cybernetic replacement from the Blood Wars. She's seen enough shit to fill a graveyard and doesn't give a damn about adding to it. She wears form-fitting leather that emphasizes her curves while concealing multiple weapons.

<TYPE>Scene introduction</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
The ancient crypt exhales an aura of primordial dread that seeps into the very marrow of your bones. Shadows dance like phantoms in the flickering torchlight, painting grotesque tableaus upon walls that have witnessed centuries of unspeakable horror. The air hangs thick with the miasma of decay and forgotten sins, while somewhere in the stygian darkness, the melodious tinkling of water droplets creates a symphony of impending doom. Each footstep upon the moss-covered flagstones echoes like thunder in the oppressive silence, announcing your presence to whatever nameless horrors lurk in the tenebrous depths below.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This scene introduction is drowning in atmospheric purple prose. We get it - it's a spooky crypt. Every single element has been turned into a dramatic metaphor when simpler description would be more effective.
- Purple prose: EXTREME - "primordial dread," "stygian darkness," "symphony of impending doom," "tenebrous depths"
- Over-description: YES - every sensory detail is overdramatized
- Clichés: MANY - dancing shadows, unspeakable horror, nameless horrors
- Length: TOO LONG - could set the scene in half the words
- Mature content: N/A
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
The ancient crypt reeks of decay. Torchlight flickers across the damp stone walls, creating shifting shadows. Water drips somewhere in the darkness ahead. Your footsteps echo on the moss-covered floor, unnaturally loud in the silence.

<TYPE>Story intention</TYPE>
<REVIEW>
This narrative shall be a profound exploration of the human condition, delving into the labyrinthine depths of moral ambiguity where the dichotomy between righteousness and malevolence becomes but a gossamer veil. Readers will embark upon an odyssey through psychological landscapes that challenge their preconceived notions, forcing them to confront the Jungian shadows within their own psyche. Expect a symphony of philosophical discourse interwoven with visceral action sequences that serve as metaphorical representations of internal struggles.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This reads like someone swallowed a philosophy textbook and a thesaurus. It's trying to say "this story explores moral gray areas and has action with deeper meaning" but makes it sound like a graduate thesis.
- Purple prose: SEVERE - "labyrinthine depths," "gossamer veil," "Jungian shadows"
- Over-description: YES - simple story intentions made pretentiously complex
- Academic pretension: EXTREME - unnecessary philosophical jargon
- Length: TOO LONG - could explain the story's intent much more simply
- Mature content: N/A
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
This story explores moral gray areas where right and wrong blur together. Readers will face challenging psychological themes and question their assumptions. The action sequences reflect internal character struggles.
