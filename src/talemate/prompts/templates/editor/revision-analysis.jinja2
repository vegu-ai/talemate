<|SECTION:TASK|>
1. Analyze each issue separately, taking into account the instructions and guidelines for it.
2. Specifically compare against previous messages, instead of rewriting the same information often it is better to just drop the repetitive sentence entirely. Its no use to convey the SAME information again just with different words. Repeat back your understanding of this concept.
3. Tell us your confident plan for fixing the issues.
4. Rewrite the text to fix the issues, the best you can, according to the plan you made.
  - Keep your changes minimal, don't get carried away. DONT MAKE IT LONGER. This is NOT about adding detail.

Repeat back your understanding of the task, then work and report each step 1 - 4, sequentially.
