<|SECTION:TASK|>
Based on the previous line '{{ last_line }}', create the next line of narration. This line should focus solely on describing sensory details (like sounds, sights, smells, tactile sensations) or external actions that move the story forward. Avoid including any character's internal thoughts, feelings, or dialogue. Your narration should directly respond to '{{ last_line }}', either by elaborating on the immediate scene or by subtly advancing the plot. Generate exactly one sentence of new narration. If the character is trying to determine some state, truth or situation, try to answer as part of the narration.

Be creative and generate something new and interesting, but stay true to the setting and context of the story so far.
