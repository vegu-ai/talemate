<|SECTION:TASK|>
First, explain your understanding of the analysis.

Then, based on the analysis above, suggest any chapters to read that may help guide the story editors in writing the next bit of narration that causes {{ character.name }} to exit the scene.

{% if narrative_direction %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ narrative_direction }}".{% endif %}

You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) that show notable exits by {{ character.name }}.

Explain how the referenced chapter demonstrates:
- Their exit patterns in similar situations and how they handle leaving unresolved matters
- Any missing context that could inform their current departure

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."
