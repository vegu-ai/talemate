# Groups

All templates are stored in groups. Each group can contain multiple templates and multiple types of templates. When starting out, start by creating a new group and then add templates to it.

## Creating a group

To create a group, find the **:material-plus: Create Group** button in the left sidebar and click it. 

![world editor templates create group 1](/talemate/img/0.26.0/world-editor-templates-create-group-1.png)

In the form that appears, enter a name, author, and description for the group.

### Group name

The name / label of the group. This is the name that will be displayed in the list of groups.

### Author

Some free-form text to indicate who created the group.

### Description

A longer description of the group. What templates are in it? What is the purpose of the group?

Once you've filled out the form, click the **:material-cube-scan: Create Template Group** button to create the group.
