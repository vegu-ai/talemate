# Details

**Details** are low to high detail information about the character. They could contain information about the character's background, history, or other relevant information.

To add or change the details of a character, open the :material-earth-box: **World Editor** under the :material-account-group: **Characters** tab. Then click on the :material-account-details: **Details** tab.

!!! note "Tracked states and details"
    When a **:material-image-auto-adjust: state reinforcement** is updated, the value is set to the corresponding detail. Learn more about tracked states in the [Tracked states](/talemate/user-guide/world-editor/characters/states) section. 

## Adding a detail

To add a new detail find the **New detail** input in the top right corner of the **Details** tab. Type in 
the detail you want to add and press the **Enter** key.

!!! tip
    The detail name can be a descriptive title or a question. 
    
    So `Where did Kaira grow up?` and `Kaira's childhood home` are both valid details.

    When using the AI generation features to generate content we have found that questions generally work better.
