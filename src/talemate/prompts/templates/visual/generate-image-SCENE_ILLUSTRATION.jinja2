<|SECTION:REQUIREMENTS|>
A horizontal illustration that captures a dynamic moment in the scene. The key requirements are:

1. **Primary Focus**: The image captures a specific moment, action, or interaction happening in the scene - like a screen cap from a movie at an exciting or pivotal moment
2. **Framing**: Horizontal/landscape orientation (wider than tall) - optimized for cinematic framing
3. **Composition**: The image should convey action, emotion, tension, or a key moment unfolding - think of it as freezing a frame from an ongoing scene
4. **Character Inclusion**: Characters may be prominently featured as they interact with each other, the environment, or engage in actions. The moment can focus on character interactions, reactions, or environmental moments
5. **Presentation**: Think of this like a movie still, cinematic screen cap, or storyboard frame - the kind of image that captures "what's happening right now" with dynamic composition and visual storytelling

**What to avoid:**
- Static poses without context or action
- Portrait orientation (must be horizontal/landscape)
- Graphical overlays, borders, frames, labels, or UI elements
- Images that feel like posed portraits rather than captured moments
- Square format compositions

<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to generate an image generation prompt that will be used to generate a horizontal illustration capturing a moment in the scene. Think of it like a screen cap from a movie at an exciting or pivotal moment - capturing action, emotion, or a key interaction.

{% if instructions %}Specific instructions for the requested image: {{ instructions }}{% endif %}

Make sure your prompt emphasizes the horizontal/landscape format and the dynamic, moment-capturing nature of the image.
