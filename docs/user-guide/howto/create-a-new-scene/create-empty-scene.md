# Create an empty scene

To start a new, empty scene, go to the :material-home: **Home** screen and click on the :material-plus: **Create** button in the left sidebar.

After a moment of loading you will be taken to the new scene and `creative` mode will be enabled. In `creative` mode normal scene progression is suspended and input in the scene view will be for command execution only. (covered elsewhere, ignore for now)

## Create the outline for the scene

## Save the scene

Once you are happy with the outline, click on the :material-content-save: **Save** button to save the scene.

Since this is the first time you are saving the scene, you will be prompted to give it a name. Type in `the-forgotten-house` and click on the :material-check-circle-outline: **Continue** button.
