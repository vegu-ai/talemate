Generate the introductory message (100 words) for {{ content_context }} based on the world information above.

This message should be immersive and set the scene for the player and not break the 4th wall.

The context is a text based game played from the perspective of {{ scene.get_player_character().name }}.

This would be the first message displayed to the player as they enter a new game.

This text should set the scene and give the player a sense of the world they are in.
{% if prompt -%}
Premise: {{ prompt }}
{% endif -%}

Use a narrative writing style that reminds of mid 90s point and click adventure games.
