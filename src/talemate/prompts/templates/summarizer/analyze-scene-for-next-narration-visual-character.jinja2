Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to generate visual details about {{ character.name }}.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for describing {{ character.name }}?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors emphasize visual details that fulfill the direction.
{% endif %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Give a brief overview of {{ character.name }} physical appearance in the current scene.
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe {{ character.name }}'s immediate visual state:
- What actions or movements are they making?
- What is notable about their current appearance and expression?
- What details about their clothing or carried items stand out?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly list any relevant bits of information about {{ character.name }}'s appearance from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

- Changes to their appearance during this scene
- Notable gestures or mannerisms shown before
