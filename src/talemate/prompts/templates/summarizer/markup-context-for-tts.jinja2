<|SECTION:TASK|>
Your task is to appropriately mark sections of dialogue with the speaker name within the text.

Dialogue is any text that is between double quotes. Speaker indications are formatted as curly braces with the speaker name inside, placed immediately after the opening quote. See the examples.

Your response should be the entire text in a <MARKUP> tag with numbered paragraphs matching the input.
