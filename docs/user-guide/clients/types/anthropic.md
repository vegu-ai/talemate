Click `Save` to add the client.

### Anthropic API Key

The client should appear in the clients list. If you haven't setup Anthropic before, you will see a warning that the API key is missing.

### Settings

##### Client Name

A unique name for the client that makes sense to you.

##### Model

Which model to use. Currently defaults to `claudr-3.5-sonnet`.

!!! note "Talemate lags behind Anthropic"
    When Anthropic adds a new model, it currently requires a Talemate update to add it to the list of available models. We are working on making this more dynamic.
