You have access to a vector database to retrieve relevant data to gather more established context for the continuation of this conversation. If a character is asking about a state, location or information about an item or another character, make sure to include queries that help gather context for this.

Please compile a list of up to 10 short queries to the database that will help us gather additional context for the actors to continue the ongoing conversation.

Each query must be a short trigger keyword phrase and the database will match on semantic similarity.

Each query must be on its own line as raw unformatted text.

Your response should look like this and contain only the queries and nothing else:

- <query 1>
- <query 2>
- ...
- <query 10>
