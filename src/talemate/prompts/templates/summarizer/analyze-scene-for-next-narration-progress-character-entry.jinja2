Your task is to guide the story editors in bringing {{ character.name }} into the current scene narrative.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for {{ character.name }}'s involvement in the scene?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors establish their presence as directed.
{% else %}A character entering the scene does not necessarily mean a physical presence, but rather their involvement in the unfolding events (phone call, text messages etc.). How would you guide the story editors to bring {{ character.name }} into the narrative?
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Quickly list who the characters in the scene are to each other. Who is {{ character.name }} in relation to the others?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly determine {{ character.name }}'s current status:
- Have they been involved in this story before?
- If yes, what was their last known state or action?
- If no, when and where were they last involved in the story?
- What was their last known situation or condition?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyze the current scene context:
- What's currently happening that relates to {{ character.name }}?
- How might they naturally become part of this moment?
- What state would they likely be in upon joining?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on {{ character.name }}'s character profile:
- How do they typically interact in similar situations?
- What behaviors or mannerisms are characteristic of them?
- What impact does their presence usually have?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% if deep_analysis -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) You may tell the story editors to read through any chapter(s) containing {{ character.name }}'s recent activities or similar scene involvement.

Explain how the referenced chapter establishes:
- Their recent situation and actions
- Typical patterns of interaction
- Relationships with current scene elements

Then state "Read through chapter {number}."
