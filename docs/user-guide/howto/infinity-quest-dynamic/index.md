The main purpose of this tutorial is to take you through the process of setting up a dynamic scene creation process using the node editor.

It will document the process of porting over the original `Infinity Quest - Dynamic Scenario` scene which relied on jinja2 templates to drive its dynamic content to the new `Infinity Quest - Dynamic` scenario, using the node editor introduced in `v 0.30.0`.

The tutorial is structured in a way that goes from very intermediate to fairly complex, but you can exit at any point and have something functional.

While not extensive, it will cover most of the core concepts of the node-editor.
