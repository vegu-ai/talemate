# Introduction

The node editor is introduced with version `0.30.0` and is a major new feature in talemate.

It allows the code-less creation of more complex scenes and scenarios.

Documentation is a work in progress.

Please see the [Infinity Quest Dynamic - HowTo](/talemate/user-guide/howto/infinity-quest-dynamic/) for a crash course on how to use the node editor.
