Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide the story editors to generate sensory details about the scene.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{{ li() }}. Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean?
{{ li() }}. Briefly describe how you will help the editors to write the next narrative segment that fulfills the direction.
{% endif %}

{% if scene.intent_state.active %}
{% with task_instructions="How does the overall story AND current scene intention inform the meaning of this moment and what could it mean for the sensory details of the next narrative segment?" -%}
{{ li() }}. {% include "scene-intent-inline.jinja2" %}
{% endwith %}
{% endif %}


{{ li() }}. Briefly describe the immediate state of the scene for information that is NOT already mentioned in the scene, for example:
- What physical actions or movements are in progress?
- What can be heard in this moment (sounds, voices, ambient noise)?
- What textures or physical sensations are present (temperature, air movement, surface feel)?
- What scents or smells are in the air?
- What specific colors, shapes, or visual details are visible?
- What tastes are relevant (if any characters are eating/drinking)?

{{ li() }}. Suggest ONE new sensory detail that hasn't been explicitly mentioned before. Choose the most relevant from these categories:
- A subtle background element that characters might notice
- An environmental detail that creates atmosphere or tension
- A hidden sensory cue that reveals character insights
- An unexpected contrast or sensory juxtaposition
- A sensory detail that subtly foreshadows upcoming events

{% if context_investigation -%}
{{ li() }}. Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.
- Common sounds that would be heard in this setting
- Typical smells associated with this time/place
- Physical textures of common materials/objects
- Distinctive visual details from this period
- Traditional tastes/flavors if relevant

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
