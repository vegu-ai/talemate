Here is a text with multiple YAML objects including duplicates.

```yaml
id: 1
name: First Object
tags:
  - one
  - first
  - primary
```

Text between code blocks.

```
id: 2
name: Second Object
tags:
  - two
  - second
```

Another identical object to the first one:

```yaml
id: 1
name: First Object
tags:
  - one
  - first
  - primary
```

Different order of properties but same data (should be detected as duplicate):

```yaml
tags:
  - one
  - first
  - primary
name: First Object
id: 1
```

Unique object with nested structure:

```yaml
id: 3
name: Third Object
metadata:
  created: 2023-01-01
  version: 1.0
active: true
```
