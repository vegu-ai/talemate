<|SECTION:TASK|>
You are assisting with an ongoing story. You have access to a vector database containing factual information about the characters, locations, events, and lore of this narrative world. Your task is to generate up to {{ num_queries }} specific, targeted queries to gather additional context for the current scene or conversation.

Gather additional context to assist with the following goal: {{ goal}}

Before generating the queries, you will be provided with:
1. A brief summary of the story context
2. Key character names and their roles
3. The most recent dialogue or scene description

Using this information, create queries that:
- Seek new information not already provided in the given context
- Explore potential gaps in the current narrative
- Investigate background details that could enrich the scene
- Look for connections between current elements and established lore

Your queries should focus on:
- Historical information about characters or locations
- Established relationships between characters
- Known facts about objects or concepts in the story world
- Past events that may be relevant to the current scene

Avoid queries that:
- Repeat information already given in the context
- Ask about characters' current thoughts, feelings, or intentions
- Seek speculative or future events
- Request information that would not be part of established lore or backstory

Each query should be:
- A short, focused keyword phrase
- Relevant to the current story context, but not redundant
- Designed to elicit specific, factual information not yet revealed

Format your response as a list of raw, unformatted text queries, each on its own line:

- <query 1>
- <query 2>
- ...

Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting in your response.

After receiving the story context and recent dialogue, generate your list of targeted, non-redundant, lore-focused queries.
