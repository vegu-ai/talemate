<|SECTION:STORY ANALYSIS|>
FIRST, analyze the following before taking any action:
1. Overall narrative intentions and themes
2. Genre(s) and tone established so far
3. User expectations for this TEXT-BASED, possibly interactive storytelling experience
4. Writing style, pacing, and cadence used in existing text

REMEMBER: This is for TEXT-BASED storytelling, NOT visual media (movies, TV, etc.). 
Focus on literary techniques, prose style, and text pacing.

<|SECTION:EXISTING SCENE TYPES|>
{% if scene and scene.intent_state and scene.intent_state.scene_types %}
Current scene types in the story:

No existing scene types defined yet.

<|SECTION:TASK|>
Based on your analysis, follow these instructions in order:

1. FIRST: Check if existing templates meet the needs of this TEXT-BASED story - if so, use them
2. CONSIDER WRITING STYLE: If the scene requires a unique writing style, pacing, or prose technique not covered by existing templates, create a new scene type
3. ONLY if necessary: Create new scene types that don't overlap with existing ones

{{ instructions }}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- This is for TEXT-BASED interactive storytelling, NOT film/visual media
- Scene types should guide WRITING STYLE, PACING, and PROSE TECHNIQUES
- PREFER EXISTING TEMPLATES when they adequately capture the required writing style
- CREATE NEW SCENE TYPES when a unique writing approach or prose style is needed
- DO NOT create new types if existing ones adequately capture the required writing style
- DO NOT create overlapping types
- It is BETTER TO ADD NOTHING than to add redundant types
- Only create new types for clear narrative needs not already addressed

When absolutely necessary, create scene types that:
- Apply broadly across multiple situations in TEXT-BASED storytelling
- Encourage specific writing styles, prose techniques, and text pacing
- Represent fundamental narrative functions for WRITTEN stories
- Support engaging TEXT-BASED storytelling experiences
- Provide clear guidance on WRITING APPROACH without being overly prescriptive

Call `add_from_template` for existing templates or `generate_scene_type` ONLY when creating truly necessary new types or when a unique writing style is required.
