# OpenRouter API Setup

Talemate can use any model accessible through OpenRouter.

You need an OpenRouter API key and must set it in the application config. You can create and manage keys in your OpenRouter dashboard at [https://openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

Once you have generated a key open the Talemate settings, switch to the `APPLICATION` tab and then select the `OPENROUTER API` category. Paste your key in the **API Key** field.
