Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide natural narrative progression.
{% set narrative_direction = agent_context_state.get("narrator__narrative_direction") or "Slightly move the current scene forward." %}
{% if narrative_direction %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ narrative_direction }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors to write the next narrative segment that fulfills the direction.
{% endif %}

{% if last_message -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Analyze the meaning of the current moment in the scene. What was the meaning?

``` the current moment in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe the immediate state of the scene:
- What physical actions or movements are in progress?
- What sensory details are present but not yet highlighted?
- What is the current focus of attention?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Propose how the scene could progress next based on what has happened so far and may have been established previously. This must be a short list of instructions and considerations, not narrative text. (Aim for 2 - 3 items)
