# Attributes

Attributes are short descriptions of a character's defining characteristics. They are used to help players understand the character's personality, background, and motivations. Attributes are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide a quick snapshot of the character's most important traits.

To manage a character's attributes, open the :material-earth-box: **World Editor** and navigate to the **Characters** tab. Select the character you want to edit, then click on the **:material-format-list-bulleted-type:  Attributes** tab.

the attribute you want to add and press the **Enter** key.
