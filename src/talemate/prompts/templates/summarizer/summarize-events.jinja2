Provide a compressed, short summary for {{ section_name }}.

Do not repeat any information from the previous context. 

Compress each individual chunk, keeping the start and ending points as anchors. 

Ensure the persistence of all important moments, decisions and story developments. 

Specifically mention characters, locations and objects by name. 

Consider the other chunks and the history to inform the context of the summarizations. Each chunk must be summarized in a way that it leads into the next chunk.

YOU MUST NOT ADD COMMENTARY.
YOU MUST NOT ADD COMBINED SUMMARIZATION OF ALL CHUNKS.

You must provide your response in the following format:

CHUNK 1: <summary of the first chunk>

CHUNK 2: <summary of the second chunk>
