# Anthropic API Setup

Talemate can use Anthropic for text generation.

You need to have an API key for Anthropic and set it in the application config. You can manage your Anthropic API keys at [https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)

Once you have your key open the Talemate settings and click the `APPLICATION` tab and then the `ANTHROPIC` category. Here you can add your Anthropic API key.
