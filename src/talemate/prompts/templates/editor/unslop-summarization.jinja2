<REVIEW>
As the crimson fingers of dawn caressed the slumbering city, our intrepid heroes embarked upon their perilous journey into the unknown. The weight of destiny pressed heavily upon their shoulders as they traversed the treacherous mountain passes, each step bringing them closer to their inevitable confrontation with fate itself. Through trials and tribulations that would break lesser mortals, they persevered with unwavering determination.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This reads like someone's trying to make "they traveled to the mountains" sound like epic poetry. Summaries should be clear and direct, not buried in metaphors about destiny and crimson fingers.
- Purple prose: SEVERE - "crimson fingers of dawn," "intrepid heroes," "inevitable confrontation with fate"
- Clichés: EXTREME - every phrase is a fantasy trope
- Essential information: Heroes traveled through mountain passes at dawn
- Length: TOO LONG - simple journey over-dramatized
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
At dawn, the heroes began their journey through the mountain passes toward their destination.

The battle was a symphony of chaos and carnage. Blood painted the battlefield in macabre artistry as steel clashed against steel in a deadly dance of death. Warriors fell like autumn leaves before a hurricane's wrath. When the dust settled and the screams of the dying faded into haunting silence, Marcus stood victorious but forever changed by the horrors he had witnessed. Half his men lay among the corpses, their sacrifice etched eternally upon his soul.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: While this needs to convey that the battle was brutal and costly, it's drowning in death metaphors. "Symphony of chaos," "deadly dance of death" - we get it, people died. Keep the important facts without the poetry.
- Purple prose: EXTREME - "symphony of chaos," "macabre artistry," "deadly dance of death"
- Clichés: MANY - "dust settled," "forever changed," "etched upon his soul"
- Essential information: Brutal battle, Marcus won but lost half his men
- Length: OVERWRITTEN - key facts buried in purple prose
- Mature content: PRESERVE - violence and death are plot-relevant
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
The battle was brutal and chaotic. When it ended, Marcus had won but lost half his men. The heavy casualties and violence he witnessed left him deeply affected.

</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This is trying to make "Sarah found a magic book and learned from it" sound like a religious experience. Just tell us what happened without the dramatic flourishes.

- Over-description: YES - simple discovery made overly complex
- Essential information: Sarah found an old magic book that taught her powerful knowledge
- Length: TOO LONG
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>

<REVIEW>
The revelations of that fateful night sent shockwaves through the very foundations of their existence. Everything they had believed to be immutable truth crumbled like ancient parchment before the flames of reality. The conspiracy reached into the highest echelons of power, its tentacles of corruption stretching back through generations of carefully orchestrated deception. Trust became a luxury they could no longer afford as allies revealed themselves as enemies and enemies as pawns in a game whose rules they were only beginning to comprehend.
</REVIEW>

<ANALYSIS>
- Thought process: This is trying way too hard to be mysterious and dramatic. "Tentacles of corruption"? "Flames of reality"? Just tell us about the conspiracy without making it sound like cosmic horror.
- Purple prose: EXTREME - "shockwaves through existence," "flames of reality," "tentacles of corruption"
- Clichés: SEVERE - "fateful night," "highest echelons," "pawns in a game"
- Essential information: They discovered a long-running conspiracy involving powerful people, can't trust anyone
- Length: WAY TOO LONG - core plot points lost in metaphors
</ANALYSIS>

<FIX>
That night's revelations changed everything. They discovered a generations-old conspiracy involving powerful figures. Former allies turned out to be enemies, making it impossible to know who to trust.
