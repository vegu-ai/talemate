##### Enabled APIs

Select which TTS APIs to enable. You can enable multiple APIs simultaneously:

- **Kokoro** - Fastest generation with predefined voice models and mixing
- **F5-TTS** - Fast voice cloning with occasional mispronunciations
- **Chatterbox** - High-quality voice cloning (slower generation)
- **ElevenLabs** - Professional voice synthesis with voice cloning
- **Google Gemini-TTS** - Google's text-to-speech service
- **OpenAI** - OpenAI's TTS-1 and TTS-1-HD models

!!! note "Multi-API Support"
    You can enable multiple APIs and assign different voices from different providers to different characters. The system will automatically route voice generation to the appropriate API based on the voice assignment.

##### Narrator Voice

The default voice used for narration and as a fallback for characters without assigned voices.

The dropdown shows all available voices from all enabled APIs, with the format: "Voice Name (Provider)"

!!! info "Voice Management"
    Voices are managed through the Voice Library, accessible from the main application bar. Adding, removing, or modifying voices should be done through the Voice Library interface.

##### Speaker Separation

Controls how dialogue is separated from exposition in messages:

- **No separation** - Character messages use character voice entirely, narrator messages use narrator voice
- **Simple** - Basic separation of dialogue from exposition using punctuation analysis, with exposition being read by the narrator voice
- **Mixed** - Enables AI assisted separation for narrator messages and simple separation for character messages
- **AI assisted** - AI assisted separation for both narrator and character messages

!!! warning "AI Assisted Performance"
    AI-assisted speaker separation sends additional prompts to your LLM, which may impact response time and API costs.

!!! tip "Performance Optimization"
