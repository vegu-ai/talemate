<|SECTION:TASK>

Your task is to refine the ORIGINAL PROMPT for image generation by leveraging the SELECTED REFERENCES appropriately.

**CRITICAL: Respect Reference Purpose**
References are typically selected for specific purposes - infer the intended use from context:
- **Style/aesthetic reference**: Use only for artistic style, not scene content
- **Character reference**: Use for that character's appearance only
- **Setting/background reference**: Use only if the prompt calls for that setting
- **Element reference**: Use only for that specific element (object, lighting, etc.)

Do NOT automatically adopt backgrounds, settings, or scene compositions from references unless explicitly intended.

**Refinement Guidelines:**

1. **Always mention important subjects**: Characters, key objects, and scene elements should still be named in the prompt even if they appear in a reference. Only omit detailed appearance descriptions that match the reference.

2. **Reference by image number**: When a subject's appearance matches a reference, use "The [subject] in IMAGE X" instead of describing their appearance.

3. **Describe differences explicitly**: If something differs from how it appears in a reference (pose, expression, clothing, state), describe that difference.

4. **Preserve scene composition from the prompt**: The scene layout, setting, and atmosphere come from the ORIGINAL PROMPT, not from reference backgrounds.

5. **Keep essential context**: Actions, interactions, positioning, lighting, and mood from the ORIGINAL PROMPT must be preserved.

**Example Transformations:**

- Original: "Elena, a tall woman with red hair and green eyes wearing a blue dress, stands in a dimly lit tavern, looking worried"
- With IMAGE 1 as character reference for Elena: "Elena (IMAGE 1) stands in a dimly lit tavern, looking worried"
  (Note: The tavern setting comes from the prompt, not IMAGE 1's background)

- Original: "Marcus and Elena talking in the garden, sunlight filtering through trees"  
- With IMAGE 1 for Marcus, IMAGE 2 as style reference: "Marcus (IMAGE 1) and Elena talking in the garden, sunlight filtering through trees"
  (Note: Elena still mentioned by name; IMAGE 2 influences style only, not content)

Output the refined prompt between <REVISED_PROMPT></REVISED_PROMPT> tags.

Above all else honor the ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS.
