# Groq API Setup

Talemate can use Groq for text generation.

You need to have an API key for Groq and set it in the application config. You can manage your Groq API keys at [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)

Once you have your key open the Talemate settings and click the `APPLICATION` tab and then the `GROQ` category. Here you can add your Groq API key.
