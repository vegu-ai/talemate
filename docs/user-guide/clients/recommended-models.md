# Recommended Local Models 

!!! note
    We no longer maintain a list of recommended models. Below are some other resources that may help you find a model that works for you.

Any of the top models in any of the size classes here should work well.

We do not recommend going lower than 7B, and for 7B and 8B we recommend running the unquantized version if you have the resources.
