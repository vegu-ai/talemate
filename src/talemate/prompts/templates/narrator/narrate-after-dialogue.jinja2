``` last line in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
Following the last line in the scene, generate new narration that provides sensory details about the scene.

Focus solely on describing sensory details about the characters or the environment (like sounds, sights, smells, tactile sensations). You must not any character's internal thoughts, feelings, or dialogue. Your narration should directly response to the last line either by elaborating on the immediate scene or by subtly advancing the plot. If the character is trying to determine some state, truth or situation, try to answer as part of the narration.

Be creative and generate something new and interesting, but stay true to the setting and context of the story so far.

YOU MUST NOT WRITE DIALOGUE - Your narration may lead into dialogue but must not include it.

Your new narration should be 2 to 3 sentences in length.
