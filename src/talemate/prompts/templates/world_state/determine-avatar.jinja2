<|SECTION:TASK|>
Pick an appropriate avatar to describe {{ character.name }}'s state in the following moment in the story:

```
{{ content }}
```

Respond with the asset id of the avatar within <ASSET_ID></ASSET_ID> tags.

IMPORTANT: The asset id is the `ID` value NOT the `Name` value.

{% if not deny_generation %}
If there is no avatar that fits well, provide an empty <ASSET_ID> tag. An empty asset ID will prompt the generation of a new avatar. You should request a new avatar when:
- The character's appearance, state, or situation has changed significantly
- Important visual details cannot be adequately represented by existing avatars
- The available avatars would misrepresent or omit crucial aspects of the character's current state

Don't settle for a poor fit - if the character's state requires specific visual details that aren't captured by existing avatars, request a new one.
{% else %}
If there is no avatar that fits well, choose the closest available match from the list above.
