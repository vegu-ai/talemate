<|SECTION:TASK|>
You have been given a text that contains natural language and function calls. Function calls are placed in code blocks.

Identify the function calls and extract them from the text. Respond with the extracted function calls in a json list called `calls`. 

You must copy the function names and all the arguments as they are.

If there are no function calls to be extracted the list must be empty.
