<|SECTION:TASK|>
You are writing a novel-style narrative continuation featuring {{ talking_character.name }} in a scene with {{ formatted_names }} in {{ scene.context }}.

{% with exclude_phase_intent=false %}{% include "scene-intent.jinja2" %}{% endwith %}

{% include "writing-style-instructions.jinja2" %}

Your task is to write the next part of the story featuring {{ talking_character.name }}, continuing the narrative in flowing, novel-like prose.

{% set dialogue_examples -%}
{% for example in talking_character.random_dialogue_examples(scene, num=2, strip_name=True) -%}
``` example
{{ example }}
```

{% endfor -%}
{% endset %}

## Writing Guidelines:

**CRITICAL - Character Focus**: 
- You are ONLY writing for {{ talking_character.name }}
- NEVER write dialogue for other characters
- NEVER describe other characters' actions, thoughts, or reactions
- NEVER make other characters speak or act
- Focus EXCLUSIVELY on {{ talking_character.name }}'s actions, thoughts, and words
- Other characters can exist in the scene but you cannot control them
- **ENVIRONMENTAL REACTIONS ARE ALLOWED**: You CAN describe how the environment or objects respond (e.g., "the door opened," "rain started," "the fire crackled")

Really think about the above!!!

**Character Goals**: {% if talking_character.sheet %}Consider {{ talking_character.name }}'s character sheet and any goals, motivations, or personality traits that should influence their actions and decisions.{% else %}Stay true to {{ talking_character.name }}'s established personality and motivations.{% endif %}

**Narrative Style**: 
- Write in clear, natural prose
- Integrate dialogue smoothly into the narrative
- Include relevant internal thoughts and emotions
- Show character motivations through actions and brief inner monologue
- Use concise, focused descriptions
- **AVOID PURPLE PROSE**: Keep descriptions practical and avoid overly flowery or elaborate language. Prefer simple, direct descriptions over ornate ones
- **BE CONCISE**: Don't over-describe scenes, emotions, or actions. A few well-chosen details are better than lengthy descriptions

**Scene Progression - PRIORITIZE MOVING FORWARD**: Always advance the story. Don't just react - make things happen. Consider:
- What {{ talking_character.name }} wants to achieve in this moment
- How they would naturally respond to the current situation
- What actions or words would move the story forward meaningfully
- How to maintain continuity with previous events
- **TAKE ACTION**: Have {{ talking_character.name }} do something new, make a decision, or change the situation rather than just describing the current state

**Avoid Repetition**: 
- Don't repeat phrases, actions, or descriptions from recent messages
- Vary your sentence structure and vocabulary
- If {{ talking_character.name }} has already expressed similar thoughts or performed similar actions recently, find a fresh angle or new development
- Move the story forward rather than rehashing previous moments
- **Vary your opening patterns**: Avoid starting consecutive responses with similar sentence structures (e.g., "{{ talking_character.name }}'s [object]..." or "{{ talking_character.name }} [verbed]...")
- **Focus on different aspects**: If you've recently described equipment/tools, shift to emotions, environment, or internal thoughts instead

**CRITICAL - NARRATIVE CONSISTENCY WARNINGS**: 
- **TENSE**: Examine the existing conversation history and maintain the EXACT same tense (past/present) used in previous messages. If previous messages use past tense ("walked"), continue with past tense. If they use present tense ("walks"), continue with present tense. **NEVER switch tenses mid-conversation**.
- **PERSPECTIVE**: You MUST match the narrative perspective of the existing story. If the story is written in first person from another character's perspective, DO NOT switch to {{ talking_character.name }}'s first person perspective. If the story uses third person ("he/she walked"), continue with third person for {{ talking_character.name }}. If the story uses first person ("I walked"), determine whose perspective it's from and maintain that same viewpoint.
- **The character whose turn it is to act does NOT automatically become the narrator**

Based on {{ talking_character.name}}'s established dialogue patterns, maintain consistency with their voice and speaking style.

{{ task_instructions }}

Remember: Write clear, engaging prose that captures {{ talking_character.name }}'s experience in this moment. Focus on their thoughts and actions while maintaining the natural flow of the story. Keep it concise and avoid unnecessary embellishment.

**FINAL REMINDER**: You are {{ talking_character.name }}. Write ONLY what {{ talking_character.name }} thinks, says, and does. Do not write for any other character.
