{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{{ li() }}. Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for the visual elements?
{{ li() }}. Briefly describe how you will help the editors emphasize visual details that fulfill the direction.
{% endif %}

{{ li() }}. Brielfy list who the characters in the scene are to each other. (Active or referenced)

{% if last_message -%}
{{ li() }}. Briefly explain the meaning of the current moment in the scene.

Following this moment:
```
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}

{{ li() }}. Briefly describe the immediate visual state of the scene:
- What actions or movements can be seen?
- What is the state of the environment?
- What specific details about character appearances are noteworthy?
- What objects or items are visually prominent?

{% if scene.intent_state.active %}
{% with task_instructions="Given the overall story and current scene intention, what visual details would the reader expect to have vividly described in the next narrative segment? Remember, you are not supposed to progress the story, but enhance the description of the current moment." -%}
{{ li() }}. {% include "scene-intent-inline.jinja2" %}
{% endwith %}
{% endif %}

{% if context_investigation -%}
{{ li() }}. Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

- Established visual elements from earlier in the scene
- Previously described features of the environment
- Known details about character appearances
- Significant objects or items mentioned before
- Any visual changes that have occurred during the scene

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
