Some text before the code block.

```yaml
calls:
- name: act
  arguments:
    name: Kaira
    instructions: Take a small step back and spread your hands in a placating gesture. Speak in a calm, soothing tone and say: "I can see you're scared, Elmer, and I'm sorry. I know this is a lot to process. Let's just take a breath, okay? I'm not going to let anything happen to you. We'll figure this out together."
```

And some text after the code block.

Another code block with list items having colons:

```yaml
instructions_list:
- Take action: Run to the door and say: "Wait for me!"
- Look around: Check for exits and say: "Is there another way out?"
```

End of file.
