Your task is to guide the story editors in crafting {{ character.name }}'s exit from the current scene.

{% if agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ agent_context_state["narrator__narrative_direction"] }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean for {{ character.name }}'s departure?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors create an exit that fulfills the direction.
{% else %}
How would you guide the story editors to bring {{ character.name }} out of the current scene.
{% endif %}

{% set last_message = scene.last_message_of_type(["character", "narrator"]) %}
{% if last_message %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Analyze the meaning of final line the scene. How does it set up {{ character.name }}'s exit?

``` the final line in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Analyze the immediate scene context:
- What is {{ character.name }} currently doing?
- What motivates or prompts their departure?
- What state are they leaving in (emotional, physical, etc)?
- How does their exit affect the ongoing scene?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Based on {{ character.name }}'s character profile:
- How do they typically handle departures?
- What parting gestures or behaviors are characteristic of them?

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

- Unfinished business they're leaving behind
- Impact of their departure on other characters present
- Any objects or items they need to take or leave

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
