<|SECTION:REQUIREMENTS|>
A portrait-oriented image that focuses on a single character. The key requirements are:

1. **Subject Focus**: The image centers on ONE specific character who should be clearly visible and recognizable
2. **Framing**: Portrait orientation (vertical format), typically showing the character from head to upper body, or full body
3. **Composition**: The character should be the sole subject - no other characters should be present in the image
4. **Environmental Context** (optional): The character may be shown within an environment/setting, but the environment serves only as context/background - the character remains the primary focus
5. **Presentation**: Think of this like a character showcase or profile image - the kind of image you might see on a character profile page or character roster

**What to avoid:**
- Multiple characters in the same image
- Group scenes or interactions between characters
- Images where the environment/setting overshadows the character
- Graphical overlays, borders, frames, labels, or UI elements
