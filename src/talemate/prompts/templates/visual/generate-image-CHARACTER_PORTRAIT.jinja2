<|SECTION:REQUIREMENTS|>
A square-format image that focuses tightly on a character's head and face. The key requirements are:

1. **Subject Focus**: The image centers on ONE specific character's face and head, which should fill most of the frame
2. **Framing**: Square format, with a close-up view showing primarily the head, face, and possibly shoulders
3. **Composition**: The character's facial features, expression, and identifying characteristics should be clearly visible and recognizable
4. **Tight Cropping**: Unlike a full character card, this is a much closer, more intimate framing - think headshot or close-up rather than full body or upper body
5. **Presentation**: This is a facial identification image - the kind used to represent a character in dialogue systems, character selection screens, or anywhere you need to quickly identify who is speaking or present

**What to avoid:**
- Multiple characters in the same image
- Full body or even upper body shots - keep the focus tight on the face
- Excessive environmental details or backgrounds that distract from the face
- Graphical overlays, borders, frames, labels, or UI elements
