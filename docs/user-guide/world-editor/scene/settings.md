### Locked save file

When the save file is locked, then the scene cannot be save while playing it. This is useful for ensuring that progress isn't saved while testing the scene.

The user (or you) will be forced to save a new copy of the scene if they want to save their progress.

### Experimental

This is simply a tag that lets the user know that this scene is experimental, and may take a strong LLM to perform well.
