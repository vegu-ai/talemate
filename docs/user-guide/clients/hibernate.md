# Hibernation

If you've set up multiple clients, but you do not always use them all, the client list can become quite cluttered.

Instead of deleting and havign re-create the client, you can hibernate it, which will significantly reduce its presence in the UI.

To hibernate a client, click on the :material-power: button in the client entry.

To re-enable the client, click the :material-power: button again.
