##### Auto save

If enabled the scene will save everytime the game loop completes. This can also be toggled on or off directly from the main screen.

If a scene is set to be immutable, this setting will be disabled.

##### Auto progress

If enabled the game will automatically progress to the next character after your turn. This can also be toggled on or off directly from the main screen.

##### Max backscroll

The maximum number of messages that will be displayed in the backscroll. This is a display only setting and does not affect the game in any way. (If you find your interface feels sluggish, try reducing this number.)

## :material-human-edit: Default character

![App settings - Game - Default Character](/talemate/img/0.29.0/app-settings-game-default-character.png)

Lets you manage a basic default character.

This is only relevant when loading scenes that do not come with a default character. (e.g., mostly from other application exports, like ST character cards.)
