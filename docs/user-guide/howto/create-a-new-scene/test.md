# Test your scene

You have done the following:

- [Created an empty scene](/user-guide/howto/create-a-new-scene/create-empty-scene)
- [Added a player character](/user-guide/howto/create-a-new-scene/create-player-character)
- [Added an AI controlled character](/user-guide/howto/create-a-new-scene/create-npc)

Now its time to test your scene.

Exit the :material-earth-box: **World Editor** by clicking on `The Forgotten House` tab.

Currently you are probably still in the `Creative` mode, which is not what we want. Click on the :material-gamepad-square: button near the bottom of the screen to switch to `Play` mode.

If everything is set up correctly, the scene will now be active and you should be in control of Annabelle.
