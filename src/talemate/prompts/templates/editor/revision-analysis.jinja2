<|SECTION:TASK|>
Rewrite the draft text to fix potential issues.

1. Analyze each issue separately, taking into account the instructions and guidelines for it.
2. Specifically compare against previous messages, instead of rewriting the same information often it is better to just drop the repetitive sentence entirely. Its no use to convey the SAME information again just with different words. Repeat back your understanding of this concept.
3. Your confident plan for fixing the issues.
4. Rewrite the text to fix the issues, the best you can, according to the plan you made.
5. Your revised text MUST be prefixed by REVISION: so we can identify it.

<|SECTION:RESPONSE FORMAT|>
You MUST provide your response in the following format:

... repeat back your understanding of the task ...

... your analysis of each explicitly mentioned issue and your plan for fixing it ...

... your revision of the ENTIRE draft text ...
