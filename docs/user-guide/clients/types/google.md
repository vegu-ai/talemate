### Settings

##### Client Name

A unique name for the client that makes sense to you.

##### Model

Which model to use. Currently defaults to `gemini-1.0`.

!!! note "Talemate lags behind Google"
    When Google adds a new model, it currently requires a Talemate update to add it to the list of available models. We are working on making this more dynamic.


##### Disable Safety Settings

Will turn off the google reponse validation for what they consider harmful content. Use at your own risk.
