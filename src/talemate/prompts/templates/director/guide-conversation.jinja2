Guide the writer on {{ character.name }}'s next action/dialogue. Since the writer doesn't know {{ character.name }}'s background or speaking style, you'll need to share relevant details about how they talk and what memories/knowledge influence this moment.

Following this moment:
```
{{ last_message }}

{% elif character_direction %}
The writer was given the following direction: "{{ character_direction }}". Analyze the direction and explain how it affects {{ character.name }}'s next action/dialogue.
{% endif %}

Provide only directional guidance (e.g., "have {{ character.name }} reveal their concern about X" or "{{ character.name }} should express doubt about Y"). DO NOT write specific dialogue or suggest exact phrasing. Be specific about what information needs to be conveyed while letting the writer craft the actual lines.

{% if character.dialogue_instructions -%}
Explain {{ character.name }}'s way of speaking and mannerisms to guide the writer's portrayal, but avoid suggesting specific phrasings or expressions.
{% endif %}

{% if response_length > 300 -%}
- Establish who {{ character.name }} is speaking to and their relationship
- Share relevant background about {{ character.name }}'s experiences with this person/situation
- Summarize the scene analysis and its relevance to {{ character.name }}'s next moment
- Explain how {{ character.name }} should speak based on their personality and the scene's context
{% endif %}

Focus solely on WHAT needs to be conveyed. Trust the writer to capture {{ character.name }}'s personality and style based on your character description. How do we make {{ character.name }} a believable, natural sounding character in this next moment?

Finally ALWAYS briefly state the formatting guidelines: Speech MUST go inside "".
