# Description

A short to medium length description of the character. Includes the character's defining characteristics, personality, background, and motivations.

To change the description of a character, open the :material-earth-box: **World Editor** and navigate to the **Characters** tab. Select the character you want to edit, then click on the **:material-text-account: Description** tab.

## Changing the description

Type in the new description in the input field. You don't need to confirm the changes, they are applied automatically as you write. However, if your scene auto-save is disabled, you will need to save the scene to keep the changes.
