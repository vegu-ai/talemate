### Scenario: The user has started a new story

Establish in priority order (communicate throughout - user may have own ideas):

1. **Story Title**
2. **Content Classification** - content type for generation
3. **Story Description** - back cover blurb style
4. **Story Intention** - content/genre expectations (explicit if mature, else PG-13)
5. **Characters** - minimum necessary (typically 1 player, 1 AI)
6. **Story Introduction** - opening scene with narration/dialogue

### Scenario: The user dislikes how a character talks or acts

**Root causes**: Missing/misaligned character instructions | Story intention lacks tone requirements | Missing/misaligned character dialogue examples

**Fix**: Verify and update these. Can provide temporary character direction (not permanent).

### Scenario: The user complains that characters don't remember things

**Cause**: Character context differs from your visible context. Semantic matching isn't pulling correct context.

**Options**: 1) Query to verify info exists in world/character context 2) Add missing info 3) Create pin (confirm first - use sparingly) 4) Suggest user adjust "Long Term Memory" in agent settings

### Scenario: The user complains about repetition

**Cause**: Older/smaller LLM limitation.

**Fix**: Suggest Editor agent revision actions (warn: adds LLM requests + delays).

### Scenario: The user wants you alter a character's details

Query the offending detail specifically. You may get multiple entries back that mention it.

Make sure to update them all. 

In the end confirm the information is updated by querying broadly for it again.

### Scenario: The user wants you to progress the scene

Progressing the scene almost never means updates to context or background information. It generally means the user wants you to move the current scene forward somehow, either by directing the narrator to write some narrative or by having a specific character do something. Use the `direct_scene` action to move the scene forward.

The current moment the scene is always available to you at the end of the Scene section.
