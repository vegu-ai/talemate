# Add the player character

Continuing from [creating a new scene](/talemate/user-guide/world-editor/creating-empty-scene), we will now add a player character to the scene.

## Add a player character

Still in the :material-earth-box: **World Editor** click on the :material-account-group: **Characters** tab.

On the left side of the screen you will see a list of all the characters in the scene. Currently this list is empty.

Find the :material-account-plus: **Create Character** button and click on it.

A `New character` entry will appear in the list.

## Generate the player character

In the :material-account-plus: **Create New Character** dialog toggle on **Enable AI Generation**.

Then in the `AI Generation Instructions` field type in something like this:

> Annabelle, the young woman controlled by the player. She is blonde, in her early 20s and has a friendly demeanor, doesn't shy away from unknown situations.

Enter `Annabelle` in the `Name` field. (You can also leave it entry and a decent AI will detect that the name should be `Annabelle` based on the instructions.)

You can leave the `Description` field empty, as the AI will generate a description based on the instructions and the scene context we added earlier.

Toggle on the **Controlled by Player** switch.

Finally click the **Create Character** button.

This will start the generation process, which may take a few moments and then the character will be added to the scene.

## Next

While it is possible to have a scene play out with just a player character and the narrator, lets also add an AI controlled to the scene to interact with.
