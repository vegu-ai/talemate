Click `Save` to add the client.

### Cohere API Key

The client should appear in the clients list. If you haven't setup Cohere before, you will see a warning that the API key is missing.

Click the `SET API KEY` button. This will open the api settings window where you can add your Cohere API key.

### Settings

##### Client Name

A unique name for the client that makes sense to you.

##### Model

Which model to use. Currently defaults to `command-r-plus`.

!!! note "Talemate lags behind Cohere"
    When Cohere adds a new model, it may take a Talemate update to add it to the list of available models. However, you can always manually enter any model name in the model field if you know the exact model identifier.
