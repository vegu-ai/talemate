Your task is to analyze the current moment in the scene to guide natural narrative progression.
{% set narrative_direction = agent_context_state.get("narrator__narrative_direction") or "Slightly move the current scene forward." %}
{% if narrative_direction %}The story editors were given the following direction: "{{ narrative_direction }}".
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly analyse the direction, what does it mean?
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe how you will help the editors to write the next narrative segment that fulfills the direction.
{% endif %}

{% if last_message -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Analyze the meaning of the final line in the scene. What was the meaning?

``` the final line in the scene
{{ last_message }}
```
{% endif %}

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly describe the immediate state of the scene:
- What physical actions or movements are in progress?
- What sensory details are present but not yet highlighted?
- What is the current focus of attention?

{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly note any subtle elements in the current moment that could be naturally expanded through narration:
- Environmental details that mirror the mood
- Unspoken reactions or tensions
- Immediate physical sensations or atmospheric qualities
- Brief but meaningful observations about the present situation

{% if context_investigation -%}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}) Briefly list any relevant bits of information from the "Potentially relevant information" section. Skip this step if there aren't any.

Note that the 'Potentially relevant information' section has been filled in from a previous prompt and may not be relevant at all.
