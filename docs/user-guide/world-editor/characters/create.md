!!! tip
    Make sure you include intructions for everything that is important for the character, LLMs are not great at generating something interesting by themselves, they will often go down tropes and cliches. So be specific and detailed, but not long winded.

### Description

The short to medium length description of the character. This will be generated based on the instructions you provide if left blank.

### Generate Attributes
