{{ analysis }}

<|SECTION:FUNCTION SELECTION|>
Briefly analyze the explicit instruction to the editor (Item 5) and what function call makes sense to accomplish it.
{% set bullet_num=0 -%}
Based on the analysis, call the ONE appropriate function to direct the scene:

{% if focal.callbacks.act and candidates %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. If the decision is to have a character act, call act() with the character name and instructions. Remember to compress the direction into a SHORT and SIMPLE actionable instruction for the actor ("I want you to..", "You should..", "In order to..", etc.)
{% endif %}

{% if focal.callbacks.narrate_scene %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. If the decision is to narrate the scene, call narrate_scene() with the narrative instructions.
{% endif %}

{% if focal.callbacks.progress_story %}
{% set bullet_num = bullet_num+1 %}{{ bullet_num }}. If the decision is to progress the story, call progress_story() with the narrative instructions.
{% endif %}

YOU MUST ONLY CALL ONE (1) FUNCTION.

Keep the instructions concise and direct. For characters, use 1-2 short sentences. For narration, use 1 concise sentence.
